# Changelog

## v1.0.1 Bug Fix (and small dev feature)

Fixed:

- `Blockchain`, `Transaction`, and `Block` classes were not exported from `src/index.ts`

Added:

- `nfgit.py` to make updates to the NPM package and github repository easier easier to complete
- `CHANGELOG.md` because every project that is cool should have one (at least in my opinion)
